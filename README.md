# Structured

A collection of data structures and algorithms. My hope is that by implementing
this project I can learn more about Elixir, functional programming, and brush up
my knowledge on data structures and algorithms. If I do continue to use Elixir
I hope that I can use at least some of this project in the future.

## Setup

Simply clone the project, change into its directory, and run `mix` to compile
it.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jmcdonald-ut/structured.git
$ cd structured
$ mix
```

Some useful commands are shown below:
```
$ mix test # Runs the test suite
$ mix credo # Style guide/consistency enforcer
$ iex -S mix # Provides the `Structured` module in the interactive elixir shell.
```
